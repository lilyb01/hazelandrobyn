<p>Hazel and Robyn, two rabbit siblings from Wintersville, learn about the world and themselves.</p><br>
<p>In a way this is my way of learning about myself. I started developing this idea as a little passion project back in high school, and over those years the characters have been shaped and formed eventually settling on what they are now. I think now is the time I begin this webcomic for real.</p>
<p>Updates are semi-random, but I'm hoping to have a weekly schedule soon </p>
